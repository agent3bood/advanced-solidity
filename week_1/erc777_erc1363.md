https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777

ERC777 and ERC1363 are an extension/improvements over ERC20 tokens, they adds new features while keeping backward
compatibility with ERC20.

### What problems ERC777 solves

### ERC777

#### Features

- Adding the concept of operator, and address that can act on behalf of the user.
- Having default operator assigned at contract deploy time `defaultOperators() returns address[]`.
- User can approve/revoke operators `authorizeOperator(address operator)`, `revokeOperator(address operator)`.
- Adding hooks to allow or disallow receiving tokens.

#### Solves

- Users where not able to block receiving tokens.
- User can send and notify the recipient of tokens in single transaction using `tokensReceived` hook.
  - Instead of doing `approve` then `transferFrom`.

#### Issues

- Complicated design
- Anti pattern where it uses global registrar to check if receiver is compatible.
- Reentrancy

### ERC1363

#### Features

- Adds hooks than can be run before or after sending tokens
  - `transferAndCall` transfer then call `onTransferReceived`
  - `transferFromAndCall` transfer from then call `onTransferReceived`
  - `approveAndCall` approve then call `onApprovalReceived`

#### Solves

- Having to do multiple transaction to notify the receiver of tokens.

#### Issues

- Reentrancy
